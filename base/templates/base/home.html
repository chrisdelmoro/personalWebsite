		<p>&#128513; Hi, I'm Christian, and welcome to my website.</p>
		<p>&#128393; I created this website to help me reinforce what I learn through the creation of tutorials.</p>
		<p>&#129690; I consider myself a maker in training. I love to created and fix things. Both digitally and IRL.
		I am currently learning a lot about programming and computer science.</p>
		<p>&#128506; I'm based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.</p>
		<p>&#128445; If you decide to follow my articles here, don't expect the
		topics to always be computer science related. Since I have a lot of
		interests, ranging from programming to woodworking. I can post about pretty
		much anything here.</p>
